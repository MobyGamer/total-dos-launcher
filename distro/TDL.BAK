; PATH-like variable that specifies where TDL can find the archive files
; prepared by the indexer and copied over to the vintage system.
; Multiple locations are allowed to get past the FAT16 2-gigabyte limit.
; (DOS limitations cap this path string at 80 characters -- do not exceed!)
proglocations=files;d:\projects\tdl\output\files;c:\archives;d:\archives

; Cache directory location.
cachelocation=c:\temp\cache.dir

; In order of control and features: kiosk, regular, power:
; - "regular" is the default and recommended mode, where the TDL will try
;   to make educated decisions where applicable.
; - "power" displays more messages and gives more control.
; - "kiosk" is meant for shows, conventions, and museums; it disables features
;   that could confuse novice users, and makes as many decisions on behalf
;   of the user as possible.  Keystrokes that may harm kiosk operation, like
;   ctrl-alt-delete, are trapped and disabled.  Finally, the TDL cannot
;   be exited in this mode.
userlevel=regular

; Being a power user forces logging of the debug log to a text file.
; You can force this behavior for all user levels for troubleshooting.
forcelogging=enabled

; TDL swaps itself into EMS, XMS, extended memory, or disk when launching a
; program.  If you suspect this is causing problems, you can turn it off, but
; you will have significantly less DOS RAM available for running your program.
swapping=enabled

; TDL normally preloads as much into system RAM as possible for speed. If you
; have a very large number of titles loaded (over 10,000) and do not have any
; EMS or XMS memory configured, you might run out of low DOS RAM. You can
; disable preloading to force the TDL to work, albeit at a significant speed
; penalty.
; Don't disable preloading unless you actually experience memory errors.
preloading=disabled
