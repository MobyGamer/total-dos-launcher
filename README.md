# Total DOS Launcher
The Total DOS Launcher is a system for easily loading and running thousands of DOS programs on vintage hardware.  If you're familiar with vintage gaming console "flash multicarts" that allow you to load hundreds of games onto a single console, that's what this is:  Think of the TDL as "console multicart" software for DOS.

Currently, the TDL is not ready for prime time; this documentation will change when it is.
