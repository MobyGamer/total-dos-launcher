# TDL Code of Conduct

1. The project creator and/or lead developers have final say in every
decision of the project, technical or otherwise, including overruling previous
decisions.  This is primarily to protect the original vision for the software
being compatible with any IBM PC or compatible, including 8088-based systems.
(If you want to add features that require 386+ systems, you are free to fork
the project.)  Along those lines:

1. No objectives beyond the stated objectives of this project are
relevant to the project. Any intent to deviate the project from its
original purpose of existence will constitute grounds for remedial
action which may include expulsion from the project.

1. Individual characteristics, including but not limited to, body, sex,
sexual preference, race, language, religion, nationality, or political
preferences are irrelevant in the scope of the project and will not be
taken into account concerning your value or that of your contribution to
the project.  Discuss or debate the idea, not the person.

1. Software evolves; better implementations supersede lesser
implementations. Technical advantage is the primary evaluation metric.

1. Participation on the project equates to agreement of this Code of
Conduct.
