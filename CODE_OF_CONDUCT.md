# TDL Code of Conduct

1. Individual characteristics, including but not limited to, body, sex,
sexual preference, race, language, religion, nationality, or political
preferences are irrelevant in the scope of the project and will not be
taken into account concerning your value or that of your contribution to
the project.  Discuss or debate the idea, not the person.

2. All members have the same opportunities to seek any challenge they want
within the project.

3. Topics outside of the project will not be tolerated.  Non-technical
conflicts can be discussed in a separate space.

4. The project creator and/or lead developers have final say in every
decision of the project, technical or otherwise, including overruling
previous decisions.  (If you don't like this, you are free to fork the
project.)

6. Software evolves; better implementations supersede lesser
implementations. Technical advantage is the primary evaluation metric.

9. This Code of Conduct governs the technical procedures of the project,
not the activities outside of it.

11. No objectives beyond the stated objectives of this project are
relevant to the project. Any intent to deviate the project from its
original purpose of existence will constitute grounds for remedial
action which may include expulsion from the project.

10. Participation on the project equates to agreement of this Code of
Conduct.
